## Get Started
To get started, first of all you need to add your API key from BotFather to .env file.

---

<i>~/.env</i><br>`API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`

---

Then you need to go to `~/bin/Release/net6.0/` and run this command

`$ npm run dev`

But before doing that you need to have node installed, and run

`$ npm i`

## You're ready!
Now you're ready to go! Good luck!
